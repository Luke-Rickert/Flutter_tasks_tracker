# Flutter_tasks_tracker
A simple app that tracks tasks by date

This was the final project for my Mobile Apps class. It was definitly not the most practical app but incorporates various simple Flutter features.
The lib folder contains my code along with two necessary text files. I created this in Android Studio, but Android Studio is tough to work with sometimes so best of luck running my code.
